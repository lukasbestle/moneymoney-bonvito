# bonVito extension for MoneyMoney

This extension for [MoneyMoney](https://moneymoney-app.com/) retrieves the balance and transactions of [bonVito](https://www.bonvito.net) prepaid payment cards.

**Note:** Bonus points and discounts are currently *not* supported by this extension. I have also *not* tested accounts with multiple merchant accounts or cards. If you do have a need for these features, please get in touch.

2. Open the database directory of MoneyMoney as described on the [MoneyMoney website](https://moneymoney-app.com/extensions/).
3. Place the extension file (`bonVito.lua`) in the `Extensions` directory of your MoneyMoney database.
4. Add a new account of type "bonVito". You can log in with your credentials for <https://secure.bonvito.net/consumer/>.
